### 🚧 Ongoing Projects

- **In-depth Research on the Integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) and Spectral Methods**  
  Currently focusing on exploring the integration of the PINN framework with high-precision spectral methods (such as Fourier spectral methods, Chebyshev polynomial methods, etc.). Research focuses include: how to use spectral methods to construct more accurate spatial derivative terms, improve the smoothness of residual calculations in PINN, and enhance network training efficiency and convergence speed through orthogonal bases in the frequency domain. The goal is to bridge the gap between classical numerical methods and deep learning models to enhance the ability to solve complex physical problems.

- **Exploring the Potential of PINN in Modeling and Predicting the Navier–Stokes Equations**  
  We are attempting to apply the PINN framework to solving the Navier–Stokes equations for incompressible fluids, studying the stability and predictive capabilities of the model under different boundary conditions and initial perturbations. We plan to adopt residual-driven non-uniform sampling strategies (such as Sobol sequences and Adaptive Sampling) to reduce training point waste, and introduce physical prior constraints to mitigate oscillation issues during training. The ultimate goal is to develop a generalizable PINN model capable of analyzing turbulent and boundary layer problems.

- **Development of Multi-Scale, Interpretable Physical Neural Network Models**  
  In addition to traditional PINNs, we plan to introduce multi-scale nested network structures combined with uncertainty estimation methods to enhance modeling capabilities for complex dynamic systems. We will also explore integration with graph neural networks (GNNs) to handle scenarios involving irregular grids and non-uniform data. Additionally, we will attempt to explicitly incorporate boundary condition functions and conservation law constraints into the model to enhance its physical interpretability.

- **Developing research notes and teaching materials to promote community sharing**  
  We plan to organize past explorations in the integration of PINN, numerical methods, and deep learning, and compile them into a series of blogs or an online wiki. The content will cover classical equation solving (wave equations, diffusion equations, Navier-Stokes equations), model training techniques, error analysis methods, and more, gradually building a learning resource repository for both research newcomers and advanced users, which will be released on the FEMATHS official website.
